Example shows how to use `on_data` callback to capture and act on raw data from a device - an ANT+ heart rate monitor in this example.

If actually developing a ANT+ device, it's probably better to use the AntPlusDevice parent class in openant.devices.common; refer to how the HeartRate device has been inplemnented.
